# create-hedera-app

This is a CLI tool that initializes a new Nextjs app with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Reown, dynamic, wagmi, viem and a Foundry project for testing and deploying smart contracts. It is configured to work out of the box with the Hedera Testnet. This means that you can seamlessly integrate Bitlayer with your front-end and deploy smart contracts to it using Foundry :&#41;

```bash
npx create-hedera-app
```

## More details
The README file present in the starter app is much more comprehensive and can help you get developing in no time. It has information about both Foundry and the integration of contracts with Nextjs. Make sure to give it a read!
